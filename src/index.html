    <h1>To The River</h1>
    <h2>By Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
    <img src="/src/images/river.jpg" alt="river">
    <p>
      Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
      Of crystal, wandering water,
      Thou art an emblem of the glow
      Of beauty, the unhidden heart,
      The playful maziness of art
      In old Alberto's daughter;

      But when within thy wave she looks,
      Which glistens then, and trembles,
      Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
      Her worshiper resembles;
      For in his heart, as in thy stream,
      Her image deeply lies,
      His heart which trembles at the beam
      Of her soul-searching eyes.
    </p>
